💡 **Because every second counts in a medical emergency.**  

LifeLink is an Android application built in **Kotlin** that creates a **mesh network** using **Bluetooth** and the **Internet** to share urgent medical issues — even when traditional connectivity fails.  

Imagine being able to send a **medical SOS** that hops from one phone to another until it reaches someone who can help. That’s what **LifeLink** does.

## 🚀 How It Works  

- 🔹 **Mesh Networking** – Devices connect with each other via Bluetooth to form a local network.  
- 🔹 **Internet Bridge** – If at least one device has internet, the whole mesh can sync outward.  
- 🔹 **Medical Alerts** – Users can send issues like injury, heart attack, accident, or health emergency.  
- 🔹 **Hop-by-Hop Delivery** – If the recipient is out of range, the message travels through nearby phones until delivered.

## 📌 Problem Statement  

In medical emergencies, **time is life**. Yet:  

- Internet and mobile networks may fail in disasters, rural areas, or crowded events.  
- Critical SOS alerts often don’t reach responders fast enough.  
- People nearby (who could help) remain unaware of the emergency.  

---

## 💡 Solution  

LifeLink ensures **no one is ever truly disconnected**.  

- Uses **Bluetooth mesh** to create offline networks.  
- Uses **Internet (if available)** to expand reach.  
- Sends **medical issues + location details** to nearby users and emergency responders.  
- Bridges the gap between **patients, bystanders, and healthcare providers**.
